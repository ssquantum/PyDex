"""Image Saver
Stefan Spence 09/09/19

 - receive an image array through a signal
 - add the received image array to a list to save
 - run a thread saving images from the list into a dated 
    subdirectory under image_storage_path
 
Assuming that image files are ASCII.
This runs as a QThread in parallel to other tasks
